Tic Tac Toe
This is my first project, a simple Tic Tac Toe game made with Python. I've created three versions of the game, each with some improvements, as I've been learning the basics of Python.

Although I've tried my best to write clean and efficient code, I'm still new to programming and there may be some mistakes or inefficiencies in my code. Feel free to point them out and suggest ways I can improve.

I've learned about some basic concepts of Python such as loops, conditionals, lists, and functions, but I'm not yet familiar with some advanced terms and built-in methods. I initially planned to compile this code into functions, but I wasn't able to figure out how to do it.

I hope you enjoy playing my Tic Tac Toe game, and please let me know if you have any feedback or suggestions for future improvements!
